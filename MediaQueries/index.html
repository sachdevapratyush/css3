        <p>An article is a kind of adjective which is always used with and gives some information about a noun.  There are
            only two articles a and the, but they are used very often and are important for using English accurately.</p>
        <p>The word a (which becomes an when the next word begins with a vowel - a, e, i, o, u) is called the indefinite
            article because the noun it goes with is indefinite or general.  The meaning of the article a is similar to
            the number one, but one is stronger and gives more emphasis.  It is possible to say I have a book or I have one
            book, but the second sentence emphasizes that I do not have two or three or some other number of books.</p>
